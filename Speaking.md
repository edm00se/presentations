# Speaking

Having spoken and presented at international conferences, national user group conferences, the occasional local meetup, and internal workshops, I take pride in being able to adapt both my material and audience interaction to the needs and dynamics of the room.

My speaking experience has involved a diverse amount of range and depth per session, depending on the topic. A thorough deep dive is wonderful for a technical heavy learning and exploring session. A broad conversation can bring to light many details across lots of tool sets or needs. In the end, I let the needs drive the engagement.

## Who Am I?

I'm [a Software Developer \*][software-dev] with a background previously in the military, then emergency medicine, and now I find myself doing both mundane and interesting things with software and the software development and adjacent fields. I'm passionate about code, automation, source control, containerization, and how they can improve our processes.

## Have Questions?

You can [ask me anything\* (AMA)][ama].

## Video Content

I have a [set of short and focused videos on YouTube][youtube-docker-quick-tips], inspired by the [egghead.io lesson style][egghead-style].

I have published several videos on the [Notes in 9 screencast][ni9] (note: think video podcast).

## Previous Presentations

You can find my previously presented work on the [root page of this repository](ReadMe.md). Nearly every talk or presentation I give has its corresponding code base and slides published publicly.

## Written Work

[I have a blog][blog]. This tends to be more prolific during the winter months, with the summer months being more sparse. This is a byproduct of my lifestyle throughout the seasons of the year.
